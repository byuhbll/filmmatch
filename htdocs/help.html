<p>We need help matching films in our catalog with corresponding films in IMDb. Take a moment to decide if the film on the left is the same as on the right. The format or publication can be different so long as the film is the same.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check that the titles appear to be the same</li>
	<li>Identify the director and a couple of stars in IMDb and find them in the catalog</li>
	<li>The date in the catalog may be the publication date not the release date as in IMDb</li>
	<li>Watch out for remakes, sequels, and different films with similar names</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yes</b> = the film on the left is the same as on the right</p>
<p><b>No</b> = the film on the left is NOT the same as on the right</p>
<p><b>Never</b> = you are confident the film on the left is not in IMDb</p>
<p><b>Skip</b> = you are unsure on this one, reload with something different</p>
<p><b>Change IMDb</b> = change the film on the right to the given IMDb ID</p>
